# Research: FeeDLooP MVP - Technology Decisions and Best Practices

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Complete

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: Next.js 14+ with App Router + React 18+ + TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Full-stack framework supporting both dashboard and API endpoints
- App Router provides modern routing with server components
- Built-in optimization and performance features
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Excellent developer experience

**Alternatives considered**:
- Create React App (lacks backend integration)
- Vite + React (requires separate backend setup)
- Remix (less mature ecosystem)

### Styling Solution
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach enables rapid development
- Excellent responsive design capabilities
- Built-in design system consistency
- Easy to maintain and customize
- Small bundle size with purging

**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS Modules (more verbose)
- Styled Components (runtime overhead)
- SCSS (no built-in design system)

### Authentication
**Decision**: NextAuth.js (Auth.js)
**Rationale**:
- Native Next.js integration
- Supports multiple providers and custom credentials
- Built-in session management
- Security best practices implemented
- Active maintenance and community

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom JWT implementation (security risk)
- Firebase Auth (vendor lock-in)
- Auth0 (cost implications for MVP)

### Database and Backend
**Decision**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time + Auth + Storage)
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL provides robust relational data modeling
- Real-time subscriptions for instant feedback updates
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Auto-generated APIs reduce development time
- Self-hosted option available for enterprise

**Alternatives considered**:
- Firebase (NoSQL limitations for complex queries)
- Custom Node.js + PostgreSQL (more development overhead)
- MongoDB (less suitable for relational feedback data)

### File Storage
**Decision**: MinIO (S3-compatible object storage)
**Rationale**:
- Self-hosted solution maintains data control
- S3-compatible API enables easy migration
- Cost-effective for MVP scale
- Good performance for file serving
- Docker-friendly for development

**Alternatives considered**:
- AWS S3 (vendor lock-in, cost scaling)
- Supabase Storage (newer, less battle-tested)
- Local file system (not scalable)

### Form Handling
**Decision**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
**Rationale**:
- Excellent performance with minimal re-renders
- TypeScript-first validation with Zod
- Small bundle size
- Great developer experience
- Works well with controlled/uncontrolled components

**Alternatives considered**:
- Formik (larger bundle, more re-renders)
- Custom form handling (reinventing the wheel)
- HTML5 validation only (insufficient for complex validation)

### Widget Architecture
**Decision**: Standalone JavaScript module with CSS isolation
**Rationale**:
- Shadow DOM provides true CSS isolation
- Vanilla JavaScript ensures compatibility
- Small bundle size for fast loading
- Independent of host site's framework
- Can be loaded asynchronously

**Alternatives considered**:
- iframe-based widget (more complex messaging)
- React-based widget (framework dependency)
- CSS scoping only (potential conflicts)

## Integration Patterns

### Widget Integration Pattern
**Pattern**: Script tag + initialization configuration
**Implementation**:
```html
<script src="https://feedloop.com/widget.js" data-project-id="abc123"></script>
```

### API Design Pattern
**Pattern**: RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
**Endpoints**:
- Authentication: POST /auth/login, /auth/register
- Projects: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/projects
- Reports: GET/POST/PUT /api/projects/:id/reports
- Files: POST /api/uploads

### Database Schema Pattern
**Pattern**: Normalized relational schema with RLS policies
**Key relationships**:
- Users → Projects (many-to-many via invitations)
- Projects → Reports (one-to-many)
- Reports → Attachments (one-to-many)

### Testing Strategy
**Pattern**: Test pyramid with contract tests
**Levels**:
1. Unit tests for utilities and components
2. Contract tests for API endpoints
3. Integration tests for user workflows
4. E2E tests for critical paths

## Performance Considerations

### Widget Performance
- Bundle size target: <50KB gzipped
- Load time target: <500ms on 3G
- Lazy loading for non-critical features
- CDN distribution for global access

### Dashboard Performance
- Server-side rendering for initial page load
- Client-side routing for navigation
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Image optimization and lazy loading

### Database Performance
- Proper indexing on query columns
- Connection pooling for concurrent requests
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data

## Security Measures

### Authentication Security
- Secure session handling with httpOnly cookies
- CSRF protection built into NextAuth.js
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### Data Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention through prepared statements
- File upload validation and scanning

### Widget Security
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- CORS configuration for API access
- XSS prevention through proper escaping
- Secure communication over HTTPS only

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Docker Compose for local Supabase + MinIO
- Hot reloading for rapid development
- Environment variable management
- Automated testing pipeline

### Production Environment
- Coolify for VPS deployment
- Container orchestration
- SSL certificate automation
- Environment-specific configurations
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Conclusion

All technology choices support the MVP requirements while maintaining scalability and security. The selected stack provides:

1. **Rapid Development**: Next.js + Tailwind + Supabase enable quick iteration
2. **Performance**: Modern React patterns and optimization strategies
3. **Security**: Built-in security features across the stack
4. **Scalability**: Architecture supports growth from MVP to enterprise
5. **Maintainability**: Strong typing and testing ensure code quality

No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain - all technical decisions are finalized and ready for implementation planning.
