## ï¿½ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Software development companies need a way to collect structured feedback (bugs, feature requests, general feedback) from their clients and testers during the development process. The solution must be extremely simple to integrate (like Google Analytics) and provide a clean dashboard for managing and exporting feedback data.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Project Owner Onboarding
1. **Given** a new user visits the platform, **When** they sign up with email/password, **Then** they can create their first project and receive a unique integration script
2. **Given** a Project Owner has created a project, **When** they invite team members via email, **Then** invited users see the project in their dashboard upon login (no email confirmation needed)
3. **Given** a Project Owner wants to integrate feedback collection, **When** they copy the JavaScript snippet, **Then** the widget appears on their website as a sticky "Feedback" tab

#### Feedback Collection Flow
4. **Given** the widget is embedded on a website, **When** a visitor clicks the "Feedback" tab, **Then** a slide-out form appears with report type selection (Bug, Initiative, Feedback)
5. **Given** a user selects "Bug" report type, **When** they fill out the form, **Then** the system automatically captures diagnostic data (URL, browser info, console logs, network requests)
6. **Given** a user wants to attach images, **When** they drag-drop, paste, or click to upload, **Then** up to 5 images can be attached to the report
7. **Given** a user selects "Initiative" or "Feedback" type, **When** they write their description, **Then** they have access to rich text formatting (bold, italics, lists, links)

#### Project Management
8. **Given** feedback is submitted via the widget, **When** team members check the dashboard, **Then** the report appears instantly in the "Active" reports list
9. **Given** a team member wants to clean up old reports, **When** they click "Archive", **Then** the report moves to "Archived" view and can be restored if needed
10. **Given** project stakeholders need to export data, **When** they click "Export to CSV", **Then** they receive a file containing all unarchived (Active) reports formatted for Jira/Azure DevOps import

### Edge Cases
- **File Upload Limits**: System prevents uploading more than 5 files per report and enforces file size limits per attachment
- **Content Length**: System restricts feedback descriptions to maximum 1000 words with appropriate user feedback when limit is reached
- **Project Deletion**: System completely removes all associated reports, attachments, and project data when Project Owner deletes a project
- **Widget CSS/JS Conflicts**: Widget should use CSS isolation techniques (iframe, shadow DOM, or scoped CSS) to prevent conflicts with host website styling and JavaScript
- **Access Control**: System displays "You don't have access to this project" error when removed members attempt to access projects

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Authentication & User Management
