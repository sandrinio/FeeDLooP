## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Development teams need enhanced diagnostic capabilities when analyzing bug reports. Building upon the existing console log and network request display, they require advanced visualizations like waterfall charts, performance metrics, and intelligent correlation between errors and network failures to quickly identify root causes and performance bottlenecks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** existing bug report with console logs, **When** developer views the report, **Then** they see syntax-highlighted logs with collapsible JSON structures and pattern detection for repeated messages
2. **Given** network request data in a report, **When** developer opens diagnostic view, **Then** they see a waterfall chart showing request timing with performance categorization
3. **Given** a report with Core Web Vitals data, **When** developer analyzes performance, **Then** they see color-coded metrics with industry-standard thresholds
4. **Given** console errors and failed network requests, **When** viewing diagnostics, **Then** the system shows visual links between related errors and failures
5. **Given** large diagnostic datasets, **When** developer needs specific data, **Then** they can filter by log level, domain, resource type, and export in multiple formats

### Edge Cases
- What happens when diagnostic data exceeds storage limits?
- How does the system handle incomplete Core Web Vitals on older browsers?
- What occurs when user opts out of interaction tracking mid-session?
- How are cross-origin restrictions handled for detailed network data?

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Enhanced Data Collection (Building on existing widget)

- **FR-001**: Widget MUST collect Core Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, CLS, FID, TTI) using Performance Observer API when available
- **FR-002**: Widget MUST capture enhanced error context including unhandled promise rejections and CORS errors
- **FR-003**: Widget MUST enhance existing network request capture with resource timing data
- **FR-004**: System MUST store new metrics within existing JSON columns using structured schemas
- **FR-005**: Widget MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing data collection

### Phase 2: Storage Optimization (Leveraging existing JSON columns)

- **FR-006**: System MUST store performance metrics in existing `console_logs` or new `performance_metrics` JSON field
- **FR-007**: System MUST store enhanced error context in existing `console_logs` with structured format
- **FR-008**: System MUST store interaction data in new JSON field with opt-in consent banner displaying "This site collects diagnostic data to improve user experience" with Accept/Decline options
  * **Suggested Implementation**: Add consent banner to widget with localStorage persistence
  * **Database Change Option 1**: Use existing JSON columns (no SQL needed)
  * **Database Change Option 2**: Add dedicated columns (see SQL below)
- **FR-009**: System MUST compress large diagnostic payloads using existing GZIP system
- **FR-010**: System MUST retain diagnostic data for the lifetime of the project (no automatic deletion)

### Phase 3: Visualization Enhancement (Building on Prism.js foundation)

- **FR-011**: System MUST display network requests in waterfall chart format with timeline visualization
- **FR-012**: System MUST categorize performance using industry-standard Core Web Vitals thresholds:
  * **Critical**: >10s load time, >5s FCP, >4s LCP, >300ms FID, >0.25 CLS
  * **High**: 5-10s load time, 3-5s FCP, 2.5-4s LCP, 200-300ms FID, 0.1-0.25 CLS
  * **Medium**: 2-5s load time, 1-3s FCP, 1-2.5s LCP, 100-200ms FID, 0.05-0.1 CLS
  * **Low**: <2s load time, <1s FCP, <1s LCP, <100ms FID, <0.05 CLS
- **FR-013**: System MUST group network resources by type (Scripts, Stylesheets, Images, API calls)
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide domain analysis showing request distribution
- **FR-015**: System MUST detect and highlight repeated console messages with occurrence counts

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Progressive enhancement)

- **FR-016**: System MUST cross-reference console errors with related network failures
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide automated performance insights based on Core Web Vitals
- **FR-018**: Users MUST be able to export diagnostic data in JSON and enhanced CSV formats
- **FR-019**: System MUST support real-time filtering across all diagnostic data types
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide pattern detection for common error sequences

### Incremental Implementation Benefits

- **FR-021**: Each phase MUST be deployable independently without breaking existing functionality
- **FR-022**: System MUST gracefully degrade when new data types are unavailable
- **FR-023**: UI MUST progressively enhance as new data becomes available
- **FR-024**: System MUST maintain performance with <100ms response for filtering operations

### Key Entities

- **Enhanced Diagnostic Report**: Existing report entity with additional structured JSON fields for performance metrics, enhanced errors, and interaction data
- **Performance Metrics**: Structured JSON containing Core Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, CLS, FID, TTI) with timestamps
- **Network Timeline Entry**: Enhanced network request with timing phases (DNS, TCP, request, response) for waterfall visualization
- **Error Context**: Structured error data with stack traces, error boundaries, and correlation IDs
- **Interaction Event**: Privacy-compliant user action data (clicks, scrolls, form interactions) with anonymization
- **Visualization Config**: User preferences for chart types, filtering, thresholds, and export formats

## Implementation Notes

Based on the comprehensive analysis, this adjusted plan:
1. **Leverages existing infrastructure** - Uses current JSON columns, Prism.js, and compression systems
2. **Minimizes breaking changes** - Incremental enhancements to existing features
3. **Prioritizes quick wins** - Phase 1 can be deployed quickly with immediate value
4. **Reduces technical debt** - Builds on proven patterns already in the codebase
5. **Enables parallel development** - UI and widget enhancements can proceed independently

## Database Schema Recommendations

### Option 1: Use Existing JSON Columns (Recommended for Quick Start)
No SQL changes needed. Store new data within existing columns:
```json
// In console_logs column:
{
  "logs": [...existing logs...],
  "performance_metrics": {
    "fcp": 1234,
    "lcp": 2345,
    "cls": 0.05,
    "fid": 100,
    "tti": 3456
  },
  "error_context": {
    "unhandled_rejections": [...],
    "cors_errors": [...]
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Add Dedicated JSON Columns (Recommended for Long-term)
```sql
-- Add new columns to fl_reports table
ALTER TABLE fl_reports
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS performance_metrics JSON,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS interaction_data JSON,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS error_context JSON;

-- Add indexes for performance queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_fl_reports_perf_lcp
ON fl_reports((performance_metrics->>'lcp')::numeric);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_fl_reports_perf_fcp
ON fl_reports((performance_metrics->>'fcp')::numeric);

-- Add comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN fl_reports.performance_metrics IS 'Core Web Vitals and performance timing data';
COMMENT ON COLUMN fl_reports.interaction_data IS 'User interaction tracking (with consent)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN fl_reports.error_context IS 'Enhanced error information including stack traces';
```

### Privacy Consent Implementation
1. **Widget Level**: Add consent banner on first load
2. **Storage**: Use localStorage to persist consent choice
3. **Data Collection**: Only collect interaction data after explicit opt-in
4. **Compliance**: Provide clear data deletion mechanism

### Migration Strategy
1. Start with Option 1 (no database changes)
2. Monitor data growth and query patterns
3. Migrate to Option 2 when data volume justifies it
4. Both options can coexist during transition
