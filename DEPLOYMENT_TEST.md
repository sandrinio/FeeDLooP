# FeeDLooP Deployment Test

This file is used to test the automatic deployment workflow from GitHub to Coolify.

## Deployment Status

✅ **Production Docker Setup Complete**
- Dockerfile.production with Node.js environment scripts
- Health check endpoint at `/api/health`
- Environment variable loading via .env.production
- Multi-stage build optimized for production

✅ **GitHub Integration**
- Repository: https://github.com/sandrinio/FeeDLooP.git
- Current branch: clean-branch
- Webhook configuration documented

## Test Deployment Triggers

When you push changes to GitHub, Coolify should automatically:

1. **Detect the push event** via webhook or GitHub App
2. **Pull the latest code** from the clean-branch
3. **Build using Dockerfile.production**
4. **Load environment variables** from mounted .env.production
5. **Deploy to production** with health checks

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Health check responds at `/api/health`
- [ ] Application loads at your domain
- [ ] Environment variables are correctly loaded
- [ ] Database and Supabase connections work
- [ ] MinIO file storage is functional

**Note:** This file can be used to trigger test deployments. Each push to GitHub should trigger an automatic deployment in Coolify.
